# Questions from Week 02 Lab

- It isn't clear from the instructions. Do we need to run the create_video_store.sql file and upload the log .txt file for that?

- The instructions for part two says we need to create an anonymous block function that take one parameter. From what I understand anonymous blocks can't take parameters? Am I missing something?
