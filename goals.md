Hello all, 

My name is Alice Smith. Some of the things I love include Opera, Cricket, and Heraldry. I live in the MT time zone and my availability for team meetings is 10:00 am - 11:00 am Monday and Thursday, and 5:00pm - 7:00pm Tuesday and Wednesday.

My strengths for this course are that as I have been very much self taught, I have developed the skill of problem solving and finding solutions to my questions and needs. I learn new concepts and systems quickly and enjoy experimenting. I also have real world experience in building a database and data collection tools to integrate with existing databases and systems (Microsoft SQL Server). I was hired to develop data collection, tracking, management, and metrics for a new department as well as facilitate integration with current systems.  I have a good working knowledge of linux operating systems, including Fedora, from my personal experimentation and hobby projects. I generally have at least one project computer with a random linux flavor at any given moment. My current one is pop_os.

Areas I need to grow are improving my collaboration with others. I have usually worked alone and have difficulty integrating with others on a project.

My goals for this course are: 

Develop a more systematic approach to learning. I will implement this by writing my study goals for each reading assignment and reporting on them with myself afterwards in a dedicated study journal.

Improve collaboration with others. I will implement this by being an active participant on the discussion boards and my group projects. Achievement will be measured by both my personal grade in participation and the success of the team presentation.

Course objective I chose to to explain: Transactional Processing Model.

In SQL programming, wrapping commands in transactions prevents errors by making sure the entire process succeeds. In other words, no single command is left behind, they all succeed or no one does. The same spirit should be a part of our every day lives especially with those we love. 1 Corrinthians 12:12 illustrates this point for me:

12 For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of the body, being many, are one body; so also is Christ. 13 For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.

We are all in part of the transaction that God is working with his children. He places us where we are needed. Our success is dependent on those who come before and we impact those who come after. We are all part of the body of Christ and none of us can succeed fully on our own.
